# Durin

Durin is a library for reading and writing the [Dwarf debugging format](https://dwarfstd.org/).

It aims to support:
 * Reading DWARF 5 encoded information from ELF, MachO and PE object files.
 * Writing DWARF 5 information into ELF, MachO and PE object files.
 * Writing DWARF 5 information into assembly files.

In future it could support DWARF 4 or newer version of the DWARF standard.
